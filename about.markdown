## My Thinking, My Writing, My Life

- Even if you know the glorious sun will not rise tomorrow,  
- Even if the bright moon sinks beneath the vast ocean,  
- Even if you foresee the irrevocable tides of the world,  
- Even if the end leaves nothing but ashes,  

*You will never lose heart, but instead face it all with unyielding determination and an indomitable spirit.*
